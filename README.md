# Why we are moving to RedHatOpenshift if we already have kubernetes?
It is an entriprise grade platform that helps in accelerating the development and delivery of cloud-native-applications in to hybrid and multi cloud.

It is powered by kubernetes as a container orchestration engine and some feature from CNCF open source eco system,all tested, packaged and supported together as a comprehensive application platform by RedHat.

Kubernetes itself is a opensource software that helps in auotmation,deployments,managing and scaling containers. Organizations need to manually integrate many other capabilities such as automation,monitoring,log analysis,service mesh, serverless, developer productivity tools e.t.c in order to make it as enterprise ready platform.Whereas in other hands redhat openshift helps in acheiving this.

# Let's discuss some difference between Openshift and Kubernetes(In detailed will be found in the attached reference link below)

Kubernetes just an open source container orchestrator platform users still need to integrate other components like ingress,networking,loadbalancing,storage,monitoring,logging,multi cluster management, continuous integration and continuous delivery(CI/CD) e.t.c in order to accelerate the development and delivery containerized applications at scale. RedHat openshift these components with kubernetes at their core by it self.

# Let's see benefits of Openshift vs Kubernetes

kubernetes is a container orchestrator software that helps users managed group of hosts running Linux containers, In order to build,deploy,manage across distributed environment such as onprem, cloud, edge you require more then kubernetes
